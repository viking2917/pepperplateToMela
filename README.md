# pepperplateToMela

see the data directory for a few examples.

for the Mela file format: https://mela.recipes/fileformat/index.html

node app.js, then look in the data directory for .melarecipe
files. These can be imported one at a time into Mela, or you can zip
them up, change the extension to .melarecipes instead of .zip, and
import them all.

This code adds the custom tag 'MyCocktails' to all recipes. You'll
probably want to change that :)
