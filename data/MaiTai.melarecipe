Shake well. Pour into a highball glass and add a float of Koloa Dark Rum.\nTradition dictates a garnish of lime wedge, pineapple and an umbrella. But in the immortal words of Felix Leiter, our preference is \"keep the fruit\". Umbrellas are for tourists.\n(note: we discovered this recipe after a visit to Gaylord's on Kauai. It's the only \"tourist venue\" Mai Tai I've ever had that was worth a damn. Gaylord's is on the Kilohana Plantation, where you can also find Koloa Rum, distilled on Kauai. You can make this recipe with other rums, but then, it just wouldn't be right.)","notes":"","nutrition":"","link":"","favorite":false,"wantToCook":false,"date":1645379731244}
