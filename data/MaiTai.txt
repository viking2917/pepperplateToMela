Ingredients:
	1 oz Koloa gold rum
	1/2 oz orange liquor (triple sec, Cointreau)
	juice of 1 lime (1 oz)
	1 tsp vanilla simple syrup
	float of Koloa dark rum

Instructions:
	Combine ingredients in a cocktail shaker. Shake well. Pour into a highball glass and add a float of Koloa Dark Rum.
	Tradition dictates a garnish of lime wedge, pineapple and an umbrella. But in the immortal words of Felix Leiter, our preference is "keep the fruit". Umbrellas are for tourists.
	(note: we discovered this recipe after a visit to Gaylord's on Kauai. It's the only "tourist venue" Mai Tai I've ever had that was worth a damn. Gaylord's is on the Kilohana Plantation, where you can also find Koloa Rum, distilled on Kauai. You can make this recipe with other rums, but then, it just wouldn't be right.)
